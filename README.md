## Usage
This program should be used to reformat obsidian markdown images to work with Github README syntax. It should be run in the same folder as the images for the markdown. Obsidian makes this easy by storing everything in a "Vault".
1. It creates a directory for the project where all data will be stored. 
2. Then it utilizes regex to extract the images in the obsidian markdown, copies the image files to a new directory and renames them. 
3. Finally, it replaces the image links in the markdown and writes out to a new file. 

The '-p' project folder can then be uploaded to Github and placed in the root of the repo and all images will display correctly for the markdown document in the project folder.
